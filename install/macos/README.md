# macOS config

These scripts will set my opinionated settings for macOS, which are heavily based on [Mathias Bynens' macOS script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos).

---

To execute all scripts:

```bash
source ./_setup.sh
```

Or you can run the scripts independently:

```bash
source ./{script-file-name}.sh
```
